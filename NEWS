NEWS FOR 0.99.8
---------------
* I removed the timestampping from the swindow layer. I think it's
  better this way. As a result, though, you'll probably want to remove
  any set FORMAT_* lines from ~/.pork/porkrc. I plan on breaking
  (= fixing) the /set and preference system completely for the next release.

* Fixed bugs? Created bugs? You decide. I figured I ought to
  make a release before I really start to break things.

* Rewrote some screen i/o stuff to eliminate a lot of unnecessary
  copying of data (hopefully speeding things up a bit and saving CPU
  cycles). Optimized window scrolling routines.

* Added the ability to set a bitmask indicating which kinds of
  messages are logged and which kinds of messages trigger
  activity in a window. Check out the /win set variables, and
  I suppose the source code, if you want to use this, because,
  of course, it's not documented.

NEWS FOR 0.99.8
---------------
* I removed the timestampping from the swindow layer. I think it's
  better this way. As a result, though, you'll probably want to remove
  any set FORMAT_* lines from ~/.pork/porkrc.

* Rewrote some screen i/o stuff to eliminate a lot of unnecessary
  copying of data (hopefully speeding things up a bit and saving CPU
  cycles).

SYNTAX: set [<variable name> [<new_value>]]
	Sets a global variable. Many global variables have analogous per-window options. For example, there's a global LOG option and a per-window LOG option. Changing a global variable has no effect on per-window options in currently open windows. Any new windows that are created, though, will inherit the applicable global options when they are created.

	There are 5 types of values set variable can take: boolean, integer, string, format string, and color string. The argument for a boolean variable can either be true (or on or 1), false (or off or 0), or toggle. Toggle reverses the variables current value. Integer variables take integer values. String variables take strings that may contain embedded color codes. Color strings take one color code without the leading '%' char, or take a color code string that must begin with '%' and may specify highlighting attributes (see the help for 'color' for info). Format strings contain strings that may contain embedded color codes. Additionally, each format string recognizes one or more variables beginning with a '$' character that will be filled-in dynamically. All format variables for each format string are described below.

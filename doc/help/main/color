PORK COLOR CODES
	Pork defines color codes that allow the color of characters in strings to be specified. Color codes are of the format %%<foreground>[,<background>]. Foreground and background are valid color specifiers (described below). The comma and <background> parameter are optional. If no background color is specified, the default background color will be assumed.

	Background colors will show up as non-bold, even if they're specified as bold. This is a limitation of the terminal.

Valid color codes are:
  d = black   (%dsample%x)    D = bold black   (%Dsample%x)
  r = red     (%rsample%x)    R = bold red     (%Rsample%x)
  g = green   (%gsample%x)    G = bold green   (%Gsample%x)
  y = yellow  (%ysample%x)    Y = bold yellow  (%Ysample%x)
  b = blue    (%bsample%x)    B = bold blue    (%Bsample%x)
  m = magenta (%msample%x)    P = bold magenta (%Msample%x)
  c = cyan    (%csample%x)    C = bold cyan    (%Csample%x)
  w = white   (%wsample%x)    W = bold white   (%Wsample%x)

  x = clear all color codes for the current string.

  In addition, the following highlighting attributes can be used:
     1 = bold      (%1sample%x)   2 = reverse (%2sample%x)
	 3 = underline (%3sample%x)   4 = blink (%4sample%x)
     5 = standout  (%5sample%x)   6 = dim (%6sample%x)

  Highligting modes can be turned off by using -<num>.
  For example, '%%1bold%%-1 not bold' is displayed as '%1bold%-1 not bold'.

  Highlighting attributes, unlike colors, cascade, meaning you can accumulate highlighting attributes by specifing them one after another in a string. For example '%%b%%1%%2%%3' is bold, reverse, underline blue (%b%1%2%3like this%x). Specifying a color code in a string causes all attributes in the string to that point to be cleared. For example, '%%1%%2%%3%%b' is just blue (%1%2%3%blike this%x); '%%1%%2%%b%%3' is underline blue (%1%2%b%3like this%x).

  %%%% = literal '%'

EXAMPLES
	%%Y,b is yellow text on a blue background. (%Y,bsample%x)
	%%m is magenta text on a black background. (%msample%x)

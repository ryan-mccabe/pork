PORK KEYCODES
	Pork allows keys to be bound such that when a bound key is pressed, the command to which it is bound is executed. This help text describes the format of keycodes used by the commands that manipulate key bindings.

The following strings are names of keycodes:
  BACKSPACE    - The backspace key.
  BREAK        - The break key.
  DELETE       - The delete key.
  DOWN_ARROW   - The down arrow key.
  END          - The end key.
  ENTER        - The enter key.
  F1           - The F1 key.
  F2           - The F2 key.
  F3           - The F3 key.
  F4           - The F4 key.
  F5           - The F5 key.
  F6           - The F6 key.
  F7           - The F7 key.
  F8           - The F8 key.
  F9           - The F9 key.
  F10          - The F10 key.
  F11          - The F11 key.
  F12          - The F12 key.
  HOME         - The home key.
  INSERT       - The insert key.
  LEFT_ARROW   - The left arrow key.
  PAGE_DOWN    - The page down key.
  PAGE_UP      - The page up key.
  RETURN       - The return key.
  RIGHT_ARROW  - The right arrow key.
  SPACE        - The spacebar key.
  SUSPEND      - The suspend key.
  TAB          - The tab key.
  UP_ARROW     - The up arrow key.

The keys that cause printing characters (see isprint(3)) to be entered may be bound by specifying the character entered by pressing the key (e.g. the A key can be bound by specifying A).

Control keys can be specified using the ^<KEY> format (e.g. CTRL-A can be specified by ^A). Note that ^a and ^A are equivalent.

Meta key sequences can be specified by prepending META- to a keycode (e.g. META-a). The meta key is "alt" key on PC keyboards. The escape key will work on all keyboards. Note that META-a and META-A are not equivalent and refer to different keycodes. METAN- can be used to specify multiple instances of the meta key being pressed. For example, META2-1 corresponds to ALT+ESC-1 (or ESC-ESC-1).

Keycodes can also be specified by their hexadecimal values.

EXAMPLES
	META-^C   - meta+control-C
	META-a    - meta+lowercase a
	META10-^A - the escape key pressed 10 times followed by control-A
	b         - lowercase b
    D         - uppercase d
    PAGE_UP   - the page up key
	0x41      - A

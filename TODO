------------------
The future. Maybe
------------------

- The perl stuff needs to be rewritten (in XS instead of straight C).
    - Allow expanding perl variables on the input line (maybe with /eval).

- Support making perl and IM protocols loadable plugins (or at least add
  a configure option to allow them to be compiled that way, if desired). 

- Support per-account events (this is easy to do, but I'm not sure it's desirable).
	- Does anybody want this?

----------------------------------------
The stuff I really don't feel like doing
----------------------------------------

- The documentation is in pretty rough shape. I'd rather write code
  than documentation, though, so.. I know nobody likes writing
  documentation, but I'd really be thrilled if someone were willing
  to do some work on this. Thrilled. Seriously.

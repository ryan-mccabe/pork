As of 0.98:

--------------------------
Plans for the next release
--------------------------

- The /set system needs a complete overhaul. There ought
  to be protocol and account settings in addition to global and
  window. There needs to be an option to make things like
  /set wordwrap and its ilk retroactive to windows that
  have already been created.
    - I also need to add something like /acct save to save
      account specific settings (once I had them). Maybe
      /<protocol> save to support protocol specific settings (also
     once i add them).

- Add protocol-specific commands (e.g. /irc kline).
- Add much better /save support.
- Add missing events (mostly file transfer stuff, but probably more).


----------
The future
----------

- The perl stuff needs to be rewritten (in XS instead of straight C).
    - Allow expanding perl variables on the input line (maybe with /eval).

- Support making perl and IM protocols loadable plugins (or at least add
  a configure option to allow them to be compiled that way, if desired). 

- Support per-account events.


----------------------------------------
The stuff I really don't feel like doing
----------------------------------------

- The documentation is in pretty rough shape. I'd rather write code
  than documentation, though, so.. I know nobody likes writing
  documentation, but I'd really be thrilled if someone were willing
  to do some work on this.
